                                            Variables

A variable is a container which holds the value while the Java program is executed.
A variable is assigned with a data type.
Variable is a name of memory location.
There are three types of variables in java: 
local, instance and static.


Local Variables :
1 > Declaration : Inside methods , Constructor or Blocks.
2 > Scope : Inside methods , Constructor or Blocks. Not Outside.
3 > When variables get allocated memory : when method , Constructor or block gets executed Variable allocated memory.
                                          When get exists variable destroyed.
4> Stored Memory : Stack memory
5 > Default Values : Does not have any default values. Values Should be provided before use.
6 > Access Specifiers: Cannot be used with local variables.(public â€¦) 


Instance Variables :
1 > Declaration : Inside class but outside methods , Constructor or Blocks.
2 > Scope : Inside all methods , Constructor or Blocks within a class.(not inside the static method directly.)
3 > When variables get allocated memory : when object is created Variable allocated memory.
                                          When objects get destroyed variable release memory.
4> Stored Memory : heap memory
5 > Default Values : They have any default values.int->0,Boolean->false,String,object->null
6 > Access Specifiers: Can be used.
7> How to access : it can be called directly.
Static Method : A obj = new A();
                Obj.a;



Static Variables :
1 > Declaration : with static keyword Inside class but outside methods , Constructor or Blocks.
2 > Scope : Inside all methods , Constructor or Blocks within a class.
3 > When variables get allocated memory : when we run program and .class file is loaded variable allocated memory . 
                                         when .class file get unloaded variable gets destroyed.
4> Stored Memory : non heap memory/static memory.
5 > Default Values : They have any default values.int->0,Boolean->false,String,object->null
6 > Access Specifiers: Can be used.
7> How to access : it can be called directly.
                   By using class name.
                   By using object reference.


** You can create a single copy of the static variable and share it among all the instances of the class. 
Memory allocation for static variables happens only once when the class is loaded in the memory.
