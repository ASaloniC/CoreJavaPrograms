                              Data Types

Data types refer to the different sizes and values that can be stored in the variable. 

Byte:
Size: 1byte (8bits)
Maxvalue: +127
Minvalue:-128
Range:-128to 127[-2^7 to 2^7-1]


Short:
The most rarely used data type in java is short.
Short data type is best suitable for 16 bit processors like 8086 but these processors 
are completely outdated and hence the corresponding short data type is also out 
data type.
Size: 2 bytes
Range: -32768 to 32767(-2^15 to 2^15-1)


Int:
This is most commonly used data type in java.
Size: 4 bytes
Range:-2147483648 to 2147483647 (-2^31 to 2^31-1)


long:
• Whenever int is not enough to hold big values then we should go for long data type.
Size: 8 bytes
Range:-2^63 to 2^63-1




Floating Point Data types:

           Float                                                  double

• If we want to 5 to 6 decimal places of 
accuracy then we should go for float.        • If we want to 14 to 15 decimal places of accuracy then we should go for double.
• Size:4 bytes.                              • Size:8 bytes.
• Range:-3.4e38 to 3.4e38.                   • Range -1.7e308 to1.7e308.


boolean data type:
Size: Not applicable.
Range: Not applicable but allowed values are true or false.


Char data type:
to use any worldwide alphabets character.
Size: 2 bytes
Range: 0 to 65535.
